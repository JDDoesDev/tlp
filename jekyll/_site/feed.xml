        <title>What Exactly is &#39;Coworking&#39;?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The most common response that I get when I tell people, “Hey, people, I just opened a coworking space for La Porte County!” is “That’s awesome!  Um… what’s a coworking space?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s not entirely unexpected, it does sadden me to a point that something as amazing as coworking is such a foreign concept to the majority of the population.  An informal survey done by another coworking space owner found that roughly 10% of adults questioned had heard of a coworking space.  Of that 10%, only 3-4 people actually knew what a coworking space was or had a vague grasp of the concept.  The silver lining?  Most people wanted to know more about coworking spaces after they were told what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is coworking?  As the &lt;a href=&quot;/index.html&quot;&gt;front page&lt;/a&gt; of the site (copied from the Google definition) puts it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  Coworking is the use of an office or other working environment by people who are self-employed or working for different employers, typically so as to share equipment, ideas, and knowledge.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-what-exactly-does-this-mean-and-why-is-it-even-a-thing&quot;&gt;But what exactly does this mean and why is it even a thing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if coworking is  sharing ideas, equipment, and knowledge while working, then a coworking space is a location to facilitate coworking.  Sounds good, right?  Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coworking spaces come in all shapes, sizes, and directions.  Some are &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; with a ton of funding from sponsorships and grants, while some are small and modest coming from one or two people with a vision to bring a new style of working and thinking to their community.  Open Door Coworking definitely falls into the second category with no sponsorships or outside funding. Just a guy with a dream to bring something different and wonderful to his community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for Open Door Coworking is to give you, the people of La Porte, Michigan City, and the rest of the county, a chance to get out of your houses or coffee shops.  I want to make everything necessary for a budding entrepreneur or freelancer to succeed be within reach.  I want telecommuters to be able to separate their home lives from their work lives without having to sacrifice independence.  I want to build a community within our community of talented, smart, like-minded people together and watch the ideas form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-its-not-just-a-shared-office&quot;&gt;So, it’s not just a shared office?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely not.  The entire coworking community and mentality is founded on the belief that people work better together.  Amazing things happen when you get the right mix of professionals in a room together.  A common misconception is that coworking spaces are only for one type of professional.  People assume that only technology related fields thrive in coworking spaces, but I’ve seen health professionals, accountants, authors, bloggers, and insurance companies thrive in coworking spaces.  Social and professional networks grow, productivity increases, and members are able to actually communicate with real human people.  Before I opened Open Door Coworking, my daily conversations were with my cat.  While he’s a nice guy, I think he’s a bit of a yes-man and way too agreeable with every idea I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between shared office space and a coworking space is that the former usually means come rent an office, use the conference room, and stay to yourself.  The latter is an invitation to join the community.  The amenities are nice, but the real value is in the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-i-join-a-coworking-space-instead-of-staying-home-or-working-from-insert-go-to-workplace-here&quot;&gt;Why should I join a coworking space instead of staying home or working from [insert go-to workplace here]?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coworking space empowers you to be able to, as a freelancer or budding entrepreneur, say “I’m heading to the office!” or to invite clients to an actual conference room that isn’t in your kitchen or the middle of a crowded bistro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coworking space helps you become more creative by allowing you to bounce ideas off of your coworkers or tap resources that you wouldn’t be able to find elsewhere without an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coworking space takes care of the utilities, internet, and at Open Door, the coffee and water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coworking space costs a fraction of what a traditional office would cost with more benefits to a growing business than a traditional office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coworking space, at least Open Door Coworking, doesn’t lock you into a long term lease so if your business doesn’t do as well as you had hoped, you aren’t stuck, or, even better, if your business outgrows the coworking space, you’re free to move on to bigger, better things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coworking space distances you from home so those tempting televisions, video games, and beds don’t keep you from doing the work you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-you-waiting-for&quot;&gt;What are you waiting for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coworking space isn’t for everyone and I’m not here to claim that joining one will guarantee success, but if you’re like me and you find that you have a hard time working in places that aren’t offices or you want to be surrounded by other professionals, then a coworking space may be for you.  If you want to give it a try, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/forms/ook9usnqsn&quot;&gt;sign up for a trial day&lt;/a&gt; and see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?  Did I leave any questions unanswered, did I explain it clearly, or did I just make it more confusing?  Let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Did I Open a Coworking Space?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions I get, next to “What is a coworking space?”, is “Why open a coworking space?”  It’s definitely a fair question, and the short answer is “for the community.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, come along and imagine yourself on my train of thought.  I’ll try to do everything that I can to keep from derailing as I tell you my story.  It all started on a warm, summer day in 1982… Wait, that’s a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; far back.  Okay, when I first became a professional web developer (meaning taking it from a hobby to a paying job) I immediately began looking for work in Chicago.  In my eyes, traveling to the city every day was the only option.  There weren’t a lot of web shops in the area and job postings for web developers were either grossly underpaid or non-existent.  I did a brief stint as a freelancer, but it just wasn’t right for me, so Chicago it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I landed a job for a media group as a PHP developer and I thought it would be &lt;em&gt;GREAT&lt;/em&gt;, and it was for a while.  However, after the first few months of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;getting up at 4:30 to get on the 5:30 train&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;spending 90 minutes on the train&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;walking the 6 blocks to the office from the station&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;working my 8 hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rushing back to the station&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;90 more minutes on the train&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;drive home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;repeat as needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was burning out very quickly.  My boss recognized this and offered me a few days from home a week.  To me, this seemed like a great idea.  I was able to get off work at a decent time, sleep in until daylight on some days, and I didn’t have to suffer the scents of the train.  However, I noticed that I wasn’t as productive on my work-from-home days as I was in the office.  While the office had people holding trivial conversations across the hallway, it was still a more professional environment.  My home office was in my basement and separated from everything else in the house, but there were still dogs barking at the wind or the mail carrier or their shadow (all evil), kids running back and forth screaming as toddlers do, and just the inability to separate work from life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not realize it, but when you walk past an Xbox every time you go for another cup of coffee, it’s very tempting to tell yourself “Just one round…” and end up wasting work time that you have to make up by working later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to try my work-from-home days in local coffee shops, and they were great, but there were still distractions.  People were holding conversations so loudly that I felt like I was part of them, random lonely people saw that I was sitting by myself and assumed that I needed conversation (which I was more than happy to take part in.  You can really learn a lot about this town just by listening to some of the residents’ stories), and, depending on which shop I spent the day at, there were often baristas grossly mispronouncing names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This didn’t improve my productivity and the commute was taking its toll on my well being.  I began looking for fully remote jobs and landed the perfect job for me as a web developer for a destination marketing organization.  I went back to working from home, but I had the same concentration issues and poor productivity.  I did the coffee shops, but I couldn’t get as much done as I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was working in Chicago I made some good contacts with other web developers, so I used those contacts and asked them for recommendations.  How did they separate work and life?  Where did they go?  What did they do that kept them more focused than me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of remote workers and freelancers that I knew told me about various coworking spaces that they used in the city. I considered it, but that would put me back at commuting every day and I did &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; want to do that again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started looking and I found 2 within 40 miles of me.  One in the next county over to the east and the other in the next county over to the west, but none right here in La Porte County.  I decided to use my coffee shop experiences as market research and decided that this county could benefit from having a coworking space.  I’m obviously not the only telecommuter in town and I can guarantee that there are a lot more entrepreneurs and freelancers in La Porte and Michigan City than anyone might expect.  I was certain that a coworking space would be beneficial not only to me, but to the community in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a period of failed attempts to raise the money necessary to open a space, a property owner in La Porte came to the rescue.  He told me that he had a few larger offices that weren’t being used, and as a startup success himself, he would like to pay it forward and made me a deal on a PERFECT location for what I was trying to do.  Thus, Open Door Coworking was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the community leaders have been beyond helpful in getting the word out about the concept of coworking and the fact that there is a coworking space in La Porte County for all of the residents of the county.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can imagine yourself in the position I was in, having a hard time separating work from home life, not getting as much done as you could be, or just wanting the feeling of working from a professional environment, please don’t hesitate to schedule a &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/forms/ook9usnqsn&quot;&gt;free day of coworking or just a tour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time: Just what is coworking?&lt;/p&gt;
