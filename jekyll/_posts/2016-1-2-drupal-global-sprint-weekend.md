Join us on Saturday, January 30 and Sunday, January 31 at the OpenDoor Coworking Space in Laporte for Drupal's Global Sprint Weekend!

This sprint will focus on Drupal 8 issues, and porting modules to Drupal 8.

Not up for coding? Some examples of other activities you can do at the sprint include:

* Writing docs for core or contributed modules
* Working on presentations
* Testing or reviewing patches for core or contributed modules
* Anything else that helps make Drupal awesome!

We will start at 9:00am and continue until around 6pm.
