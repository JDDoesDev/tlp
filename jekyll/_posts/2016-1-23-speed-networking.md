Join the Greater La Porte Chamber of Commerce at Open Door Coworking for a Speed Networking event! On February 11th, come to 1705 State Street at 5:00 p.m. for a chance to network with many people in a fun, exciting way.

This is a face-to-face networking event, giving each attendee a chance for introductions and questions. Participants will speak one-on-one with other participants, switching spots after a set amount of time. Once the speed part is over, there will be time later for people to reconnect with those they wanted to talk to in more detail. Be sure to bring business cards so you can maintain new connections after the event.

A $5 donation is suggested for this event with proceeds going to the La Porte Jaycees. The Jaycees, also known as the Junior Chamber of Commerce, is an organization that provides leadership training opportunities for its members through the projects and programs the members plan, organize, and conduct in both the community and chapter. Both young women and men ages 18 through 41 are eligible to be members.

Registration is encouraged. Register by visiting [the Chamber website](http://lpchamber.chambermaster.com/events/register/2478) or calling 219.362.3178.
