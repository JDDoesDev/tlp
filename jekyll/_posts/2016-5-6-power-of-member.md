When you think about the word 'membership' it's easy to picture an exclusive club or a fashionable jacket for only members, but for coworking space managers and owners, it is holds a completely different meaning.

To us, our members are our reason for being.  Our members are evidence that we're doing something beneficial.  Our members are people who have chosen to work side by side with us.  Our members are our greatest assets.

## The Power Of A Member is to Inspire

When I first opened Open Door Coworking, it took me several months before I got my first bite.  It was a rough several months of me walking into the space every day, making my coffee, sitting at my desk in a big, empty office, and working through the day before attending events or get-togethers that might spark some interest in someone to come join up.  I had set a hard deadline for myself that if I didn't have a member by March 1, 2016, I was going to close the doors and consider it a failed endeavor.  The night of Valentine's Day I got a call on my work line at about 7:00 PM.  Thinking it was another telemarketer or other spammy industry, I let it go to voicemail.

When I listened to the voicemail it was an actual person from my actual area interested in actual office space and to become a member of my actual coworking space.  The prospect of having a member was enough to both thrill me and terrify me.  He wanted to meet as soon as possible and he was interested in my private office space.  After a few brief phone conversations, he came in, checked it out, and was ready to sign on.  The only problem was that I had never been there before.  It seemed to me that I would never find a member so I never prepared myself.  Thankfully, he was patient with me while I worked out the kinks in my onboarding process, and he continues to renew his membership monthly.

If it wasn't for him, Open Door Coworking would have been shut and locked by now.

##  The Power Of A Member is to Challenge

Two members does not a coworking space make.  I elected to work at a reserved desk in the open coworking area from the time I opened up.  The benefits of this were twofold, prospective members could see what a desk in use looks like, and I would be able to keep myself in great company once I got a few more butts in the seats.  It was several weeks again before I got my second member.  He found me through a Facebook post promoting a custom tee shirt I bought a local shop and decided that he wanted to check it out.

When you meet with a prospective member, it's a sort of interview process.  What do you do?  Where did you hear about Open Door?  What are your needs?  Et cetera.  But, the interview goes both ways.  I'm not just asking someone to join a coworking space.  I'm asking them to join me.  I'm asking them to consider working next to me.  I'm asking them to accept me as a coworker.  Sometimes, there are unavoidable personality conflicts, but more often than not, I find that I'm challenged to be a better person to make that person want to sit next to me many times a week and work with me.

## The Power Of A Member is to...

The list can go on forever.  Without the members of coworking spaces, the facilitators and owners are doing nothing more than sitting in large, empty spaces wishing they had someone to talk to.  Without the members, the community wouldn't thrive and we would just be peddling cheap office space like a landlord and not trying to build relationships.

Thank you, to all my members, current and future.  Without you, I wouldn't be here.  You all make this endeavor worth attempting and keep me going.  Thank you.
