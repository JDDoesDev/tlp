The most common response that I get when I tell people, "Hey, people, I just opened a coworking space for La Porte County!" is "That's awesome!  Um... what's a coworking space?"

While it is not entirely unexpected, it does sadden me to a point that something as amazing as coworking is such a foreign concept to the majority of the population.  An informal survey done by another coworking space owner found that roughly 10% of adults questioned had heard of a coworking space.  Of that 10%, only 3-4 people actually knew what a coworking space was or had a vague grasp of the concept.  The silver lining?  Most people wanted to know more about coworking spaces after they were told what it is.

So, what is coworking?  As the [front page](/index.html) of the site (copied from the Google definition) puts it:

<div class="center">
  Coworking is the use of an office or other working environment by people who are self-employed or working for different employers, typically so as to share equipment, ideas, and knowledge.
</div>

## But what exactly does this mean and why is it even a thing?

Well, if coworking is  sharing ideas, equipment, and knowledge while working, then a coworking space is a location to facilitate coworking.  Sounds good, right?  Right.

Coworking spaces come in all shapes, sizes, and directions.  Some are _huge_ with a ton of funding from sponsorships and grants, while some are small and modest coming from one or two people with a vision to bring a new style of working and thinking to their community.  Open Door Coworking definitely falls into the second category with no sponsorships or outside funding. Just a guy with a dream to bring something different and wonderful to his community.

My goal for Open Door Coworking is to give you, the people of La Porte, Michigan City, and the rest of the county, a chance to get out of your houses or coffee shops.  I want to make everything necessary for a budding entrepreneur or freelancer to succeed be within reach.  I want telecommuters to be able to separate their home lives from their work lives without having to sacrifice independence.  I want to build a community within our community of talented, smart, like-minded people together and watch the ideas form.

## So, it's not just a shared office?

Definitely not.  The entire coworking community and mentality is founded on the belief that people work better together.  Amazing things happen when you get the right mix of professionals in a room together.  A common misconception is that coworking spaces are only for one type of professional.  People assume that only technology related fields thrive in coworking spaces, but I've seen health professionals, accountants, authors, bloggers, and insurance companies thrive in coworking spaces.  Social and professional networks grow, productivity increases, and members are able to actually communicate with real human people.  Before I opened Open Door Coworking, my daily conversations were with my cat.  While he's a nice guy, I think he's a bit of a yes-man and way too agreeable with every idea I had.

The difference between shared office space and a coworking space is that the former usually means come rent an office, use the conference room, and stay to yourself.  The latter is an invitation to join the community.  The amenities are nice, but the real value is in the people.

## Why should I join a coworking space instead of staying home or working from [insert go-to workplace here]?

A coworking space empowers you to be able to, as a freelancer or budding entrepreneur, say "I'm heading to the office!" or to invite clients to an actual conference room that isn't in your kitchen or the middle of a crowded bistro.

A coworking space helps you become more creative by allowing you to bounce ideas off of your coworkers or tap resources that you wouldn't be able to find elsewhere without an appointment.

A coworking space takes care of the utilities, internet, and at Open Door, the coffee and water.

A coworking space costs a fraction of what a traditional office would cost with more benefits to a growing business than a traditional office.

A coworking space, at least Open Door Coworking, doesn't lock you into a long term lease so if your business doesn't do as well as you had hoped, you aren't stuck, or, even better, if your business outgrows the coworking space, you're free to move on to bigger, better things!

A coworking space distances you from home so those tempting televisions, video games, and beds don't keep you from doing the work you need to do.

## What are you waiting for?

A coworking space isn't for everyone and I'm not here to claim that joining one will guarantee success, but if you're like me and you find that you have a hard time working in places that aren't offices or you want to be surrounded by other professionals, then a coworking space may be for you.  If you want to give it a try, then [sign up for a trial day](http://goo.gl/forms/ook9usnqsn) and see for yourself.

What do you think?  Did I leave any questions unanswered, did I explain it clearly, or did I just make it more confusing?  Let me know in the comments!
