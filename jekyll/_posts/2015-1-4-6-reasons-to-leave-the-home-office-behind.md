I know what you're thinking... "My home office is just fine.  There's no reason that I should join a coworking space."

You may be right, but imagine for a second what life might be outside of the house.  Really reflect on your current situation and ask yourself if you're really as productive as you could be while working in your underwear 50 paces from your bed.  Having a hard time picturing it?  No problem!  That's what this post is all about.

<h2 class="list-header"> 1. Distractions </h2>

Distractions ruin productivity, and you and I both know that in the age we live in, disctractions are everywhere.  Your phone beeps, your watch buzzes, your computer dings, and sometimes they all happen at the same time.  These are all part of the cost of being connected, and are sometimes unavoidable.

Working from home brings its own distractions to the table.  Cats nuzzling, dogs barking, and babies crying are just the tip of the iceberg.  Some family members may have a hard time recognizing that you're actually working and expect you to drop everything to help them.  Sometimes, it's just the video game or TV in the corner calling out to you.  "Play me!  It'll only take a few minutes!"

Regardless of your distractions, they're definitely there and keeping you from doing best, but _why is a coworking space better?_

Sure, coworking spaces have their own distractions, but they are the distractions that you'd expect from an office environment and not from a house or apartment.  Your fellow coworkers are there to work and respect the fact that you are too.  At [Open Door Coworking](http://www.opendoorcoworking.com) we utilize an instant messaging application, [Slack](http://www.slack.com) for our members and are firm believers in the headphone rule, or the rule that if the headphones are on then that person is not to be disturbed.

<h2 class="list-header">2. Leave your house at home and your work at work</h2>

So, one of the most difficult parts of working from home, and I speak from personal experience on this, is that it's _very_ difficult to separate your work hours from your home hours.

<figcaption>Based on the very scientific method of me asking people who work from coworking spaces if this is how they feel</figcaption>

When you're at home, your mind and body know you're at home so the tendency to act like you're at home is there more than you might realize.  Just like the distractions, it's pretty easy to turn on the TV to watch the news, but end up catching up on Let's Make a Deal and The Price is Right and realize that it's 11:00 AM and you've squandered a few hours of the day away that could have been better put to use doing your job, making client calls, or brainstorming.  It's also easy to see that pile of dishes in the sink and find yourself doing chores instead of working.  Guess what, doing chores won't pay the bills no matter how accomplished you feel after sweeping those cobwebs out of that closet in that room in the basement that is really only there because someone didn't plan the bathroom as well as they could have.

The inverse of that is without the separation of home and job, you may find yourself sinking into work when you should be spending time with your family or significant other.  Not getting enough done is bad, but getting too much done at the cost of your personal relationships and family life is even worse.

The time you have between your home and office, going either way, acts as kind of a "buffer" between "home" you and "work" you. That's also nice because...

<h2 class="list-header">3. You get to dress the part</h2>

That's right, ladies and gentlemen.  A coworking space means you ~~have to~~ get to put on clothes for the day.  For some people, working in their pajamas/underwear is great, but unfortunately it's looked down upon in public.  Personally, I think that a nice pair of jeans and a button front shirt or sweater makes great business casual, and I just _feel_ more professional when I'm not wearing a stained tee shirt and flannel pajama pants.  Sure, it sounds awesome to not have to get dressed or shower or brush your teeth or do laundry because nobody will see you for days, but if you have any sense of self worth you quickly find yourself questioning your choices in life and running for the nearest shower.

Speaking of segues and other reasons to get cleaned up...

<h2 class="list-header">4. Grow your social network</h2>

No, I don't mean your Facebook friends, Twitter followers, or LinkedIn connections ([Open Door on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/opendoorcoworking) [Open Door on Twitter](http://twitter.com/OpenDoorCowork) and [Open Door on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-door-coworking/).  Sorry, had to!)  I mean actual human people.  We all need to have human contact at least every once in a while and you're not going to meet anyone new in your basement.  According to a [deskmag survey](http://www.deskmag.com/en/the-coworking-market-report-forecast-2014), 92% of coworkers noted an improved social circle, not to mention all of the contacts that you gain from meeting new people who might be or might know someone who is interested in your business.

It's also great to have people to bounce ideas off of.  It's really easy to trap yourself in an echo chamber at home.  A lot of the time family and friends will either a) think that everything you do is amazing, or b) not have any idea what it is you're trying to do.  At a coworking space, the other members are more likely to give honest feedback before you dump a lot of time and money into an idea that Aunt Gertrude thought sounded "just swell" and that would "make you one of those internet millionaires" when in reality you're just trying to market hair ties for cat tails.  Just trust me on that one.

<h2 class="list-header">5. Look More Professional</h2>

Now we talked about looking professional a few items ago.  Well this is a little bit different.  It's not just how you get to dress, it's also your surroundings.  You could have the nicest tailored suit from the finest shop in town, but it doesn't really matter if you're holding client meetings at a dirty kitchen table or if customers have to dodge Legos to get to your office.

A coworking space gives the appearance and feel of a professional environment for both you and your customers and clients.  With several amenities including a conference room for members to hold meetings, it makes working that much easier.

And finally...

<h2 class="list-header">6. All of the above</h2>

All of these elements combine to form a whole greater than the sum of its parts.  Working from a coworking space is _empowering_.  You get to look professional in a professional environment while maintaining a strong work life balance in a distraction-free zone while growing your social network for a fraction of the cost of renting or buying an office outright.  You get all this and you get to keep your independence as a freelancer, entrepreneur, small business owner, or telecommuter.

If you think that coworking might be for you, please give us a call at [219-561-0219](tel:219-561-0219), [email me](mailto:jd@opendoorcoworking.com), or [go ahead and schedule a tour](http://goo.gl/forms/ook9usnqsn) now and set up a day or two of trial coworking.

What about those of you who have tried coworking?  Do you agree, disagree, or something else entirely?  Let me know in the comments.
