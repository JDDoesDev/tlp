I know what you're thinking... "My home office is just fine.  There's no reason that I should join a coworking space."

You may be right, but imagine for a second what life might be outside of the house.  Really reflect on your current situation and ask yourself if you're really as productive as you could be while working in your underwear 50 paces from your bed.  Having a hard time picturing it?  No problem!  That's what this post is all about.

<h2 class="list-header"> 1. Distractions </h2>

Distractions ruin productivity, and you and I both know that in the age we live in, disctractions are everywhere.  Your phone beeps, your watch buzzes, your computer dings, and sometimes they all happen at the same time.  These are all part of the cost of being connected, and are sometimes unavoidable.

Working from home brings its own distractions to the table.  Cats nuzzling, dogs barking, and babies crying are just the tip of the iceberg.  Some family members may have a hard time recognizing that you're actually working and expect you to drop everything to help them.  Sometimes, it's just the video game or TV in the corner calling out to you.
