A wise man once told me, "What do you think you're doing opening a coworking space without first building a community?"  Everything I read about opening a space told me that I should be working on cultivating a community before trying to create a coworking space, but I went rogue and started the company first and then got the community going.

So why did I go about it this way?  Well, it's no secret that La Porte and Michigan City are in a bit of a void when it come to getting the word out about something new, and I actually tried building the community, but I had a hard time for several reasons.

* The community doesn't have as many events as a bigger city
* There is a significant hole in my target demographic, millennials
* There aren't a lot of places to hold meetups
* People don't know about [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com)

I did some research, made some calls, and found that there wasn't a lot to unite like-minded individuals.  There also weren't an abundance of locations to hold meetups in the county.  The libraries had some space available, but with limited hours and space it was not the best option.  There are plenty of bars and restaurants, but I didn't want people to feel obligated to have to spend money to come and join in the conversations.  I wanted to build a community, but there was nothing available to use as a clubhouse.

Against every bit of advice I got, I decided to open a space and build the clubhouse before the club.  In my ignorance, I thought that I heard a voice from the field saying "If you build it; they will come."  As with any business, this was not the case.  I had to build a community, and let me tell you, it is _HARD_ in an area like La Porte and Michigan City.  There are only so many media outlets and it's difficult to tell which medium is going to reach the most appropriate audience so I tried the shotgun method.

I advertised on Facebook and saw a very, very poor return on investment.  I sent press releases to every media outlet and got a few page views, but most saw the press releases as too much like an advertisement.  Guilty as charged.  I was trying to get free advertisement, but I was also trying to get the word out about a completely new concept to the area.  I did manage to get the attention of one newspaper, but the interest that it created was negligible.

More recently, I had 15 minutes of fame on a [local AM radio station](http://www.wimsradio.com) which sounds a lot less awesome than it really was.  The morning host, Ric Federighi, made the interview flow and kept it interesting instead of me droning on about how great I think coworking is and why everyone should do it.  It was an amazing experience, but after checking the Google Analytics of [opendoorcoworking.com](http://www.opendoorcoworking.com) I saw that the impact was once again not there.

So, here's my problem.  I have a space and I have the support of many community leaders who all think that a coworking space is going to be great for the area, but what I don't have is a strong method to get the word out about the space and its benefits. So, has anyone had experience building a community in a small city with only a few methods of mass communication?  If so, let me know in the comments or on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jddoesdev) or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/opendoorcoworking).
