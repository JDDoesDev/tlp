So you've decided that working from home is the best option for you.  That's awesome!  I tried it for a while, but I found that I need some human contact and to get out of the house in order to do the best work that I can.  In fact, I opened a business because of it.  However, I did pick up a few pointers in my time working from my basement that helped me work better and kept me on track AKA employed.

1. ## Start the day off right
No, I don't mean have a balanced breakfast, although that is important, I mean treat your home office like an office.  If you're going to work, then act like it.  Wake up, take a shower, get dressed, and do something to separate your work from your home-life.  Some people do well with a walk or run, some people can drive around the block and get that distance.  Personally, I liked to watch the news and walk around the block to get the working juices flowing.
1. ## Make sure your home life respects your work life
This is one of the hardest possible things to do while working from home, especially if you live with your significant other or have kids.  Working from home requires that you put up a wall of separation between home and work.  If the people you live with aren't prepared, then you need to have a discussion.  Whether you're working for a distributed office somewhere else in the country or working for yourself as a freelancer or entrepreneur, if the people you cohabitate with do not respect that you're working and not just hanging out then they are going to be more likely to distract you without thinking twice.
It's easy for people to assume that working from home means you're only going to be "kinda" working and be at their beck and call when they need you.  *DON'T LET THEM THINK THAT!*  You are getting paid to work or working towards getting paid.  Close your door, put on some headphones, and request that they only contact you through email or slack.
1. ## Make sure you _can_ separate work from home
It's easy to take a break that is supposed to last the time it takes you to get a cup of coffee and head back to your office and find yourself distracted by some dishes that need washing, laundry that needs folded, a TV that needs watched, or a conversation that someone tries to start.  DO NOT FALL INTO THIS PIT!  If you were working from an office or coworking space then those chores would be waiting for you when you got off.  Let them wait until you get off.  You have your time to work and your time for chores.  Don't mix them.
1. ## Set rules for your housemates AND yourself
There are literally TONS of apps and tools out there that are designed to make you more productive.  One of the best that I've found is a [Pomodoro timer](http://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730).  Basically, you set a 25 minute timer and work your butt off during that 25 minutes.  Focus only on your task at hand and work, work, work!  Take a 5 minute break to rest your eyes, check your email, look at your phone, etc. and then set another 25 minute timer and GO!  Repeat this 4 times, then take a 15 minute break.  Eight cycles of this and it's time for lunch!
Some rules to consider for those around you:
    * The Headphone Rule - If your headphones are on, you are not available.
    * The Door Rule - If the door is closed, it had better be something extremely important for it to be opened
    * The "You know I'm Working" Rule - If someone knows that you're working, they need to let you work

1. ## Get out of the house
If your housemates, spouses, family, or cat still can't grasp that you need to work while you're at home, then maybe it's time to consider another option.  Check out local coffee shops, libraries, bookstores, or coworking spaces.  I know how awesome working remotely or working for yourself sounds, but taking that plunge
These sound a bit harsh, but if your day is full of distractions and you still need to put in 8 hours, then one of two things are going to happen:  Either you're going to end up working until 9 PM every night catching up on work you missed because of distractions OR your Fridays are going to be very, very long.  There is a third option to that as well if you work remotely... your boss catches on that you're not working as well as you should be and you either get pulled back to the office or, worse, fired.

The most important thing is that you make sure you're really ready to work from home.  It sounds great and the stories make it seem like anyone who goes out on their own to make their fortune will succeed, but the reality is that there are a lot of people who have a hard time adjusting to working from home and need that office space mentality, not to be confused with an [Office Space Mentality](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/).  Don't see having a hard time adjusting as failure.  See it as an opportunity to learn what you can do better.

Hopefully my tips help you out a bit.  Do you have any of your own?  Let me know in the comments.
