So you've decided that working from home is the best option for you.  That's awesome!  I tried it for a while, but I found that I need some human contact and to get out of the house in order to do the best work that I can.  In fact, I opened a business because of it.  However, I did pick up a few pointers in my time working from my basement that helped me work better and kept me on track AKA employed.

1. ## Start the day off right
No, I don't mean have a balanced breakfast, although that is important, I mean treat your home office like an office.  If you're going to work, then act like it.  Wake up, take a shower, get dressed, and do something to separate your work from your home-life.  Some people do well with a walk or run, some people can drive around the block and get that distance.  Personally, I liked to watch the news and walk around the block to get the working juices flowing.
1. ## Make sure your home life respects your work life
This is one of the hardest possible things to do while working from home, especially if you live with your significant other or have kids.  Working from home requires that you put up a wall of separation between home and work.  If the people you live with aren't prepared, then you need to have a discussion.  Whether you're working for a distributed office somewhere else in the country or working for yourself as a freelancer or entrepreneur, if the people you cohabitate with do not respect that you're working and not just hanging out then they are going to be more likely to distract you without thinking twice.
It's easy for people to assume that working from home means you're only going to be "kinda" working and be at their beck and call when they need you.  *DON'T LET THEM THINK THAT!*  You are getting paid to work or working towards getting paid.  Close your door, put on some headphones, and request that they only contact you through email or slack.
1. ## Make sure you _can_ separate work from home
It's easy to take a break that is supposed to last the time it takes you to get a cup of coffee and head back to your office and find yourself distracted by some dishes that need washing, laundry that needs folded, a TV that needs watched, or a conversation that someone tries to start.  DO NOT FALL INTO THIS PIT!  If you were working from an office or coworking space then those chores would be waiting for you when you got off.  Let them wait until you get off.  You have your time to work and time for chores.
