## What's in a name?

The coworking space manager/owner community is pretty knowledgeable about how to correctly term various things in our vertical that have to do with coworking spaces.  We are not community managers, we're community _facilitators_ or _tummlers_ meaning that we don't want to manage the community; we want to make the space available for the community to thrive.  We also don't ask for people to _sign up_ for our coworking spaces.  We offer them the chance to _join_ or become a part of the community.  Signing up sounds too much like enlisting, but joining or becoming a member sounds much more welcoming.  Whether conscious or not, these terms make a difference when trying to promote our spaces and propose value to potential members.

One issue that comes up now and again, aside from the "coworking" v. "co-working" debate (hint: it's "coworking" and anyone who tells you otherwise just needs to be informed) is the "coworking space" versus "tech/startup incubator" problem.  To many who aren't familiar with the concept of either, the terms are interchangable.  However, there is a huge difference between a coworking space and an incubator.

## What is the difference, if any?

### An incubator wants your business.  A coworking space would rather have your company

As crazy as that sounds, the normal operating model for an incubator is to allow tech startups and the like to work from their facilities in return for a cut of the business.  This is often measured in equity, ownership, a portion of profits, or a seat on the board.  While this isn't always the case, it is pretty common among incubators.  

So what do I mean by "a coworking space would rather have your company"?  Simply put, coworking spaces are in place for the purpose of creating a collaborative community, or building a place for you to work independently together.  Less simply put, those of us who open coworking spaces generally see a niche in the community that's somewhere between "idea in my kitchen" and "ready for my own office building."  We realize that not everyone working out of a coffee shop is trying to startup a business.  We want to be open to anyone who is need of professional office space at a low cost and without a long-term commitment.  We take our titles as facilitators and tummlers seriously and we want to bring people together.

### Who uses incubators?

In my experience, people who prefer incubators are often the startups who are seeking a place to work and handle their day-to-day while building their branding.  Incubators are often funded by equity, so if a startup within an incubator gets that ever-so-sought-after seed money from a VC, the incubator takes their chunk of the pie.  

### Who uses coworking spaces?

Coworking spaces are not aligned with any certain industry.  You'll find web developers, accountants, insurance sales, entrepreneurs, IT consultants, authors, and any number of other professionals in a coworking space.  Solopreneurs to remote workers, single person businesses to some of the largest companies in the world, they all use coworking spaces.

### Are you getting to the difference anytime soon?
Yes.  Yes I am.

Coworking spaces are much less structured than incubators in a good way.  You pay your membership, you work when you want and where you want within the terms of your membership, you use the facilities as you need to, and you grow your community and social circles.  Incubators often have set hours, where coworking spaces are usually more flexible, most of the time with 24 hour access 7 days a week for members.

Incubators are focused on the industry.  Coworking spaces are focused on the culture.  In an incubator you may work alongside other entrepreneurs, but you probably won't be considered their coworker, nor will you get the benefits of the expanded social circles and networks that having this diverse collection of coworkers might bring you.  A coworking space will bring you the chance to work alongside other people and organizations.  You'll have access to peer-to-peer mentorship to and from your new professional network.

## The biased verdict?

Look at the title of this site.  I founded a coworking space so I'm going to be completely transparent in my bias.  I prefer the coworking space, but I'm also a remote web developer not looking for VCs or seed money.  Either a coworking space or an incubator is going to be beneficial to a startup or entrepreneur, but often one will be more _right_ than the other.  A coworking space builds the community within.  It's empowering to the small businesses to have an office to bring clients to.  It looks more professional to have a conference room than a kitchen table.  It's more welcoming to a prospective customer to walk into a coworking space's entryway than it is to bring them in through the garage and past the laundry room.

For the majority of people in this area who are looking for professional office space with no long-term leases and all professional amenities included, a coworking space is going to be a better choice.
