One of the most common questions I get, next to "What is a coworking space?", is "Why open a coworking space?"  It's definitely a fair question, and the short answer is "for the community."

Please, come along and imagine yourself on my train of thought.  I'll try to do everything that I can to keep from derailing as I tell you my story.  It all started on a warm, summer day in 1982... Wait, that's a little _too_ far back.  Okay, when I first became a professional web developer (meaning taking it from a hobby to a paying job) I immediately began looking for work in Chicago.  In my eyes, traveling to the city every day was the only option.  There weren't a lot of web shops in the area and job postings for web developers were either grossly underpaid or non-existant.  I did a brief stint as a freelancer, but it just wasn't right for me, so Chicago it was.

I landed a job for a media group as a PHP developer and I thought it would be _*GREAT*_, and it was for a while.  However, the first few months consisted of
- getting up at 4:30 to get on the 5:30 train
- spending 90 minutes on the train
- walking the 6 blocks to the office from the station
- working my 8 hours
- rushing back to the station
- 90 more minutes on the train
- drive home
- repeat as needed

While I was thrilled to be a out of my old job and into something that I loved doing, I was burning out very quickly.  My boss recognized this and offered me a few days from home a week.  To me, this seemed like a great idea, but I noticed that I wasn't very productive on my work-from-home days, but I stuck with it.  I was able to get off work at a decent time
